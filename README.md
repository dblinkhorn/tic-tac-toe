Tic-Tac-Toe project
===================
1. Need to build a tic tac toe game and implement an AI of varying difficulties.
2. Gameboard will be stored in an array like so:
    [top-left, top-middle, top-right,
    center-left, center-middle, center-right,
    bottom-left, bottom-middle, bottom-right]
3. Define winning conditions:
    Player's mark in:
    a) all top positions
    b) all center positions
    c) all bottom positions
    d) all left positions
    e) all middle positions
    f) all right positions
    g) all diagonal positions
        (top-left, center-middle, bottom-right ...OR... top-right, center-middle, bottom-left)
4. Check for and announce for game tie
5. Create a function that will check after each move to determine if either player meets a winning condition
6. Players cannot place their mark in an occupied grid square
